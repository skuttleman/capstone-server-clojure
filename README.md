# The Legend of Tilde
## (server app)

This is a rewrite of my server repo for my final project at Galvanize. The original API was written in Node.js. It has been rewritten in Clojure.

This is a 2 player cooperative puzzle game. Players must communicate what they see and what they need from the other player through rudimentary symbols in order to solve the puzzles. It uses web sockets for game update notification when the player is online, or the Twilio API for SMS notification when the player is offline.
